        "1. **Dataset Loading**:\n",
        "   The `load_breast_cancer` dataset from `sklearn` is loaded, with features stored in `X` and labels (target) in `Y`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Cross-Validation Setup**:\n",
        "   - The data is split into 5 cross-validation (CV) folds using `KFold` with `shuffle=True` and `random_state=0` for reproducibility.\n",
        "   - Indices for training and testing data are stored for each fold in the `kfold_indices` dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Model Evaluation Setup**:\n",
        "   - Three models are evaluated: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree.\n",
        "   - For each model, a pipeline is constructed where features are standardized using `StandardScaler`.\n",
        "   - A hyperparameter search is performed using `GridSearchCV` for each model to find the best combination of hyperparameters on the training data for each fold.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Model Training and Prediction**:\n",
        "   - For each fold, the training and testing data are extracted using the saved indices.\n",
        "   - The models (Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree) are trained on the training data using their respective pipelines.\n",
        "   - The best model for each fold is selected via `GridSearchCV`, and predictions are made on the test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Error Rate Calculation**:\n",
        "   - After making predictions on the test data, the classification error rate is computed using `zero_one_loss`, which measures the fraction of misclassified samples.\n",
        "   - The error rates for each fold are stored in the `Error_rate` dictionary for each model.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Results Aggregation**:\n",
        "   - The mean and standard deviation of the error rates over the 5 cross-validation folds are computed for each model.\n",
        "   - These statistics are printed for each model (Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree), summarizing the model performance across the folds.\n",

        "**Pros:**\n",
        "- **Simplicity and Interpretability:** Logistic Regression is easy to implement and interpret, making it a great choice for understanding the relationship between features and the target variable.\n",
        "- **Performance:** It achieved the lowest mean error rate (0.0193), indicating strong predictive accuracy on the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons:**\n",
        "- **Linearity Assumption:** Logistic Regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the dependent variable, which may not hold true in all cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pros:**\n",
        "- **Flexibility with Kernels:** SVM can handle non-linear relationships using kernel functions, allowing it to model complex data distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Parameter Sensitivity:** The performance of SVM heavily relies on the choice of hyperparameters (C, kernel type, gamma), requiring careful tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Decision Tree**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pros:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Handling Non-linearity:** They can capture non-linear relationships without requiring data transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons:**\n",
        "- **Instability:** Small changes in the data can lead to different tree structures, resulting in model instability.\n",

        "2. **Cross-Validation Strategies:**\n",
        "   - Implement different cross-validation strategies (e.g., stratified k-fold) to ensure that the training and testing sets represent the overall data distribution accurately."
